                    Electricity is a scientific phenomenon that is associated with the presence of motion in a matter
                    which has an electric charge. The phenomena of electricity are based on magnetism because both of
                    these are a part of electromagnetism.
                    The presence of an electric charge, whether positive or negative results in the formation of an
                    electric field. The movement of an electric charge is known as an electric current, resulting in the
                    construction of a magnetic field. Electricity was always an unresolved concept for the ancient

                        transparent coloured substance on which we depend for living and also it is used for our daily
                        household chores. And you are correct, water is used mostly in every task of our life, in fact,
                        our 70% body is made up of water. It is the most precious and priceless resource that mother

                        When we talk about a garden, the first thing that comes to our mind is a place filled with
                        flowers, plants, and trees full of greenery.
                        Somehow you are correct. A garden means an area or a plot of land which is used for recreational
                        purposes where generally plants are kept.
                        Another meaning can be that a garden is an area of land next to a house that often contains
                        grass and leaves and where plants and trees are grown....

But when we hear that deforestation of trees is being done, then for one or two days we just act as taking care of them and after two or three days we live our lives normally and not giving any attention to the trees.
