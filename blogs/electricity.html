                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">
                        Electricity is a scientific phenomenon that is associated with the presence of motion in a matter which has an electric charge. The phenomena of electricity are based on magnetism because both of these are a part of electromagnetism. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">
                        The presence of an electric charge, whether positive or negative results in the formation of an electric field. The movement of an electric charge is known as an electric current, resulting in the construction of a magnetic field.

                    <p class="blog-text-heading margin-top-fix"> The invention of electricity:</p>
                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">
                        Electricity was always an unresolved concept for the ancient people until the 1600s when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote the book "De Magnete". This book involved the careful study of electricity and magnetism. A new Latin word, "electricus" which means "like amber" was also coined in this book. This word gave further rise to the English word "electric" and "electricity", Which first appeared in Thomas Brown's Pseudodoxia Epidemica in 1646. Further research was conducted by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Grey and C.F. du Fay in the later 17th and early 18th centuries.

                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">
                        After that, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity, and he even sold his possessions to fund his works. He is very well reputed because of one of his experiments which was conducted in 1752 in which a metal key was attached to a kite flying in the sky during a thunderstorm. He observed that some sparks that jumped onto the key were also felt on his hand which showed that the lightning was electrical. He also gave the theory which explained the paradoxical behaviour of the Leyden jar as a device for storing a large number of electrical charges as electricity in the form of both positive and negative charges.

                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">
                        After that, many more experiments and studies were conducted by different scientists. Luigi Galvani discovered bioelectromagnetics, in which it is clearly shown that electricity was the medium by which the neurons passed signals to the muscles. Micheal Faraday invented the concept of electric motors in 1821 which is similar to that which we use in our modern life. George Ohm also mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. And many more major experiments were conducted.

                    <p class="blog-text blog-text-normal margin-fix-para">'Electricity is generally produced in five ways:

                        As we say the word water, what strikes your mind? I am sure that you would think of a
                        transparent coloured substance on which we depend for living and also it is used for our daily
                        household chores. And you are correct, water is used mostly in every task of our life, in fact,
                        our 70% body is made up of water. It is the most precious and priceless resource that mother
                        nature has given to us. ...
