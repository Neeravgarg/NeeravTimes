                    which has an electric charge. The phenomena of electricity are based on magnetism because both of
                    these are a part of electromagnetism.
                    The presence of an electric charge, whether positive or negative results in the formation of an
                    electric field. The movement of an electric charge is known as an electric current, resulting in the
                    construction of a magnetic field. Electricity was always an unresolved concept for the ancient
